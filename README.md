# Pomodoro Timer

A Pomodoro Timer is a simple time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, usually 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This Pomodoro Timer is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that allows users to set a timer for a Pomodoro session and take breaks in between. It has the following features:

## Features

    The timer can be set for a default of 25 minutes or for a custom duration.
    Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
    The timer counts down from the set duration to 0.
    When the timer reaches 0, an alert pops up to indicate that the session is complete.
    A cycle consists of a work period and a break period. After a work period ends, a break period follows.
    A session consists of multiple cycles. The default cycle is a 25 minute work period followed by a 5 minute break period. After 4 work cycles, a longer 15 minute break is taken.
    The user can pause and resume the timer at any time during a session. The timer will continue from where it was paused.
    The user can reset the timer at any time during a session. The timer will be reset to the beginning of the current cycle.
    The user can switch to a dark mode for a more pleasant experience.
